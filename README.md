# Introduction

## Introduction

cbValidation is the server-side validation engine for ColdBox applicationsThis module is a server-side rules validation engine that can provide you with a unified approach to object, struct, and form validation. You can construct validation constraint rules and then tell the engine to validate them accordingly. You can also create validation profiles to create a more complex validation schema for fields.

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

ColdBox validation is based on a way to declaratively specify validation rules for **properties** or **fields** in an object or form. The **constraints** can exist inside of the target object or you can define object and form constraints in your ColdBox [configuration file](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LA-UVKtPMvMR4t5JRTB/s/sb0wq8dVmJlt8ukgRJyd/overview/declaring-constraints/configuration-file) so you can reuse validation constraints or as we call them: **shared constraints**. You can also create validation constraints on the fly or store them pretty much anywhere you like.You can then use 2 simple validation methods and report on the results: `validate(), validateOrFail()`
